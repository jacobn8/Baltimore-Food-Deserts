# Description:
This is a webmap representing access to food in the city of Baltimore.
It shows stores selling food, categorized by type of vendor.
It also shows the neighborhoods of baltimore, and areas classified as a 'Food Desert'

![A food desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert)
Is a place where it is difficult for residents to access affordable, nutritious food.
People with low incomes might not be able to afford healthy food, or may have less access to it.
Without access to a car, one is more limited in their options for buying food, and how much they can bring home.
Its hard to take advantage of bulk purchases when you have to carry your groceries home.
Full grocery stores also tend to be further away from low income areas, forcing residents to rely on convinence stores and other stores that tend to have higher prices, and fewer options, stocking mostly frozen foods and snacks.

This project is meant to explore a city that suffers from several food deserts, and to visualize just how many of the food sources availible in our cities are limited and insufficient.
